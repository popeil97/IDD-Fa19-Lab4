## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**

**Answer: Yellow - input , Red - 5V power, Brown - Ground**

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**

**Answer: Pin 9**

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**

**Answer: The amount of delay controls the speed. delay to speed is inversely proportional, as delay decreases, the speed increases. The angle of the end of the motor is controlled by the servo class, which takes an integer from 0-180**

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**
